"""
Module: tcp_shellcode_collector.py

Description:
Shellcode Sampler for KernelHunter.
Listens on a TCP socket, receives shellcode payloads from remote cells,
saves them automatically into the `received_shellcodes/` folder for future evolutionary cycles.
This module acts as an external genetic memory system, collecting
samples independently from the executing shellcodes.

Probable Impact:
- High - Expands the evolutionary gene pool with real-world propagated shellcodes.
- Enables tracking of evolving payloads across generations.

Risk Level:
âš¡ Moderate - Minimal execution risk, acts only as passive collector.
